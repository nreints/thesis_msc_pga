## Contributing to Ganja.js

First off, thank you to consider contributing to ganja.js !

Here are a few guidelines that will determine whether or not your contribution will make it into the ganja.js repository. Ganja.js is 
designed to be lightweight, dependency free, minimal and accessible, and it is important that your contributions fit that same mindset.

* **External Dependencies** are extremely unlikely to be accepted.
* **Coffeeshop Examples** need to be small and concise. (<60 lines)
* **README.MD Contributions** need to be funny. 
* **Algebra Generators** need to follow the existing template (see e.g. the graded generator)
* **GA Dialects** are translated, not parsed. Think regexp and string fiddling - ganja is not the place for a big AST include.

For external examples (like the Galculator or the Wedge game) more flexibility is allowed.

Get in touch (email or create an issue) to discuss the best strategy for your contribution !
